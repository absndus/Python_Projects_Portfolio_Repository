  </a>
<p><b>Description:</b> This program asks the user to enter their information about their age, sex, smoking status, BMI, numbers of children, and the name to output the insurance premium. This was part of the Code Academy mini-project. 
</p>

<h2> 2. <a href="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Projects_Portfolio_Repository/blob/main/Project_2_Medical_Insurance_Functions.py">Project 2 Medical Insurance Custom Functions Script</a></h2>

</a>
<p><b>Description:</b> This python script goes through the process of understanding how to create custom functions that can be reused again and again by calling the calculation functions over the time of the script to calculate insurance premiums each person. 
</p>

<h2> 3. <a href="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Projects_Portfolio_Repository/blob/main/Project_3_Medical_Insurance_Control_Flow.py">Project 3 Medical Insurance Control Flows Script</a></h2>

    </a>
<p><b>Description:</b> This python script goes through the process of using custom functions and else-if statements to calculate the insurance premiums for a user based on the user's inputs.
</p>
  
<h2> 4. <a href="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Projects_Portfolio_Repository/blob/main/Project_4_Medical_Insurance_Estimation.py">Project 4 Medical Insurance Estimations Using Functions Script</a></h2>

  <image src="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Projects_Portfolio_Repository/blob/main/Projects%20Screenshots/Screenshot_Program_4_US_Medical_Insurance_Functions.png" alt = "Screenshot">
    </a>
<p><b>Description:</b> In this project, I examined how factors such as age, sex, number of children, and smoking status contributed to medical insurance costs. I have applied my knowledge of Python lists and wrote the code that gives people the insurance premiums estimations.
</p>

<h2> 5. <a href="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Projects_Portfolio_Repository/blob/main/Project_5_Medical_Insurance_Advanced_List.py">Project 5 Medical Insurance Advanced Lists Script</a></h2>

  <image src="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Projects_Portfolio_Repository/blob/main/Projects%20Screenshots/Screenshot_Program_5_US_Medical_Insurance_Lists.png" alt = "Screenshot">
  </a>
  <p><b>Description:</b> In this project, I examined the insurance premiums and created two lists of names and insurance premiums. I then ordered them and manipulated the data to display the cheapest insurance premiums vs. highest premiums in an orderly fashion. 
  </p>

<h2> 6. <a href="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Projects_Portfolio_Repository/blob/main/Project_6_Medical_Insurance_Loops_Comp_Lists.py">Project 6 Medical Insurance Using Loops and Comprehension Lists Script</a></h2>

  <image src="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Projects_Portfolio_Repository/blob/main/Projects%20Screenshots/Screenshot_Program_5_US_Medical_Insurance_Lists2.png" alt = "Screenshot"></a>
  <p><b>Description:</b> In this project, I go over the insurance estimated premiums vs. actual insurance premiums using the Python comprehension lists to quickly calculate the estimated to actual insurance information. Once completed, I presented the information using the comprehension lists, which can calculate large data sets into meaningful visualizations such as bar and a histogram. </p>
  
<h2> 7. <a href="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Projects_Portfolio_Repository/blob/main/Project_7_Fridas_Museum_Advanced_Loops.py">Project 7 Fridas Museum Paintings Lists and Comprehension Lists Script</a></h2>

  <image src="https://github.com/absndus/Python_Programs_Portfolio/blob/master/program_7_list_screenshot.png" alt = "Screenshot for Program 7 Python List at Fridas Painting Gallery"></a> 
  <p><b>Description:</b> This is unlike the previous projects since this project was an open-ended project. In this scenario, I have been hired to work on a retrospective of Frida Kahloâ€™s work at a major museum in Mexico. My job was to put together the audio tour, but in order to do that, I needed to create a list of each painting featured in the exhibit, the date it was painted, and its spot on the tour.
